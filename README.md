# Weather Dashboard

Provides a quick search of current weather with a five day forecast

## Description

When you open the page you see a search bar to search for weather data around the world. The page loads with current weather for the Houston area.  When you search for a city, the data for your search becomes the active data set and the city is added to a list of previous searches. You can click on the previous searches to re-display the data. If you reload the page, the last search you made repopulates the data set.

## Installation

Navigate to the website:

 [https://phil-pfister.github.io/Weather-Dashboard](https://phil-pfister.github.io/Weather-Dashboard)

 and begin your search.

 ## Credits

 This site recieves data from the [open weather Api](https://openweathermap.org/api) and from dayjs.  I used the tools that I've learned in Rice university Boot Camp as well as research in MDN, Stack Overflow and Jquery API documentation online. I recieved information additional help during office hours from my instrutor, Brandon Gatlin on click event handlers used on the sidebar.
